# Neighborhood Map

##Overview:
This project was build using a single HTML page. The HTML page contains a Google Map, which displays my neighborhood information on the map with highlighted markers. This also contains temperature box and NY times articles about the desired city.  The map was rendered using knockout and Jquery frameworks, while the popular plaes around my neighborhood are rendered using foursquares framework.  The page also displays weather information of my location.  The functionality on the map is highly interactive, by capturing user choice. Inside my project I have am using a weather api, google maps api, NY Times api and forecast api. <br /><br />

##Instructions on how to use my Neighborhood Map Page.

Load the index.html into you chrome browser.

Default location is hicksville as I live there.  There is a google map with a star in the center of Ct.

Temperature details of hicksville is also shown in the temperature box.

Below temperature box, you will see FourSquare top picks for Hicksville and below the Map you will see New York Times articles about Hicksville.

If you click on one of the FourSquare suggestions you will see detail about it on the map.

You can change the City and State and you can also put in suggestions to narrow your FourSquare suggestions by typing something like, Pizza or
Stores or Bars or Resturant.

If you change the City/State to other town, the FourSquare suggestions and Temperature and the New York Times articles will show details for that town.
